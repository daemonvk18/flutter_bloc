Flutter BLoC State Management


What is BLoC?
BLoC stands for Business Logic Component. It's a design pattern for managing state in Flutter applications. BLoC separates the presentation layer from the business logic layer, making your codebase more maintainable and testable.

How does BLoC work?
In Flutter BLoC pattern, the UI components interact with the BLoC to fetch and update the application state. BLoC contains the business logic and state of your application. It listens to events from the UI, processes them, and emits new states.

Key Concepts:
Stream of Events: UI components send events to the BLoC using streams.
Business Logic: BLoC processes the events and updates the application state.
Stream of States: BLoC emits the updated states to the UI components.
Widgets as Stateless: UI components are kept stateless and simply display the current state provided by the BLoC.
Why use BLoC?
Separation of Concerns: BLoC separates the UI from the business logic, making the codebase easier to understand and maintain.
Testability: Since business logic is decoupled from the UI, it becomes easier to write unit tests for the logic.
Reusability: BLoC instances can be reused across different parts of your application, promoting code reusability.
Scalability: BLoC pattern scales well with complex applications, ensuring maintainability as your project grows.
Implementing BLoC:
bloc: Create BLoC classes that extend Bloc or Cubit from the bloc package.
events: Define events as classes that represent user actions or changes in the application.
states: Define states as classes that represent different states of your application.
mapEventToState: Override this method in your BLoC to handle incoming events and emit new states accordingly.
StreamBuilder: Use StreamBuilder widget to listen to state changes emitted by the BLoC and rebuild UI accordingly.
